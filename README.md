# DuplicateDelete
Tool to scan through all folders passed as arguments, identify duplicates, and save the higher resolution image. This does not use any form
of fuzzy image matching to identify duplicates. Parses through filenames of all images and chooses the image to save based on the larger
filesize. Currently works on images with the following filename formats.

imageName_resolution.ext
